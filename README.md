# SmartTrack: AI-Based International Travel Monitoring System for CSUCC OIGE

## Summary
SmartTrack helps the CSUCC Office of the International and Global Engagement (OIGE) monitor international travel records. This starter provides a Home screen and a Login placeholder with a working navigation baseline (indigo card-based UI theme).

## Current stack
- Implemented now: Flutter Web / Dart (client-side UI, widgets, navigation, forms).
- Planned only (not implemented in Activity 8): REST API backend (e.g., FastAPI) and PostgreSQL for persistent storage.
